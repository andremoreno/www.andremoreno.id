  Hello, I'm Andre\

  the guy behind [AndreMoreno.id].\

  &nbsp; \

  Photography is a passion that I am working on for some time. It all started 11 years ago when I first got in touch with photography. I received a [Nikon D5200](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikon_D5200) digital camera from my sister and a new interest was born. Passionate as I was I mostly learned by just taking and analyzing photos without lots of knowledge from books. The self-learning and exploring way still makes it just more interesting for me.\

  Im quietly capture authentic your stories knowing that people look best when unaware of the camera and are just being themselves. See more by following me on Instagram [@andremoreno](https://www.instagram.com/andremoreno)\

  I don't pretend to be a photographer, even though I find myself quite enjoying taking and processing pictures.
